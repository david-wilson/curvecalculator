Curvecalculator.com started as an exercise to teach myself some modern internet technologies, [d3.js](http://d3js.org/)being chief among them.  I chose to implement a curve calculator as it a well defined problem that nonetheless offers some interesting options for developing a useful interface.  I've opened sourced the code for this page on [GitHub page](https://github.com/david-wilson/curvecalculator), if you're interested in taking a look underneath the hood.  

The application itself is written in [d3.js](http://d3js.org/), a leading visualization library for JavaScript.  The rest of the site is statically generated using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/).  Hosting is provided by Amazon's [S3](aws.amazon.com) service.
